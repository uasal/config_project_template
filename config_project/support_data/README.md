# Support Data
Files that are to be added to the `support_data` directory should be broken into sub-directories that match their data type. 

Providing a README.md within this directory (this file) with an overview of what type of content is within each sub-directory (but not indexing it) is a useful addition. Rough example shown below:

## Coatings
Data in [coatings](/coatings/) contains csv files with Specular Reflectance values at different wavelengths per coating type. Name of the files should include what the coating is for reference if not provided already within the csv file.
